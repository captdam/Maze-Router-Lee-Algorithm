# Command to open the GUI. The GUI is an HTML application, you use this command to open web browser to view the GUI
# Command has three components, path_to_browser, option_to_browser (optional), and a "%s" which will be replaced
# by the program to the path_to_GUI_file
# You should check the browser's manual for option_to_browser
# Examples are below:

# Using firefox to view the GUI, in a new window
gui_path_command = *"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -new-window %s*

# Using firefox to view the GUI, default option (open in new tab)
#gui_path_command = *"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" %s*

# Using firefox to view the GUI, in a new window. In this case, firefox is in your system path
#gui_path_command = *firefox -new-window %s*

# If you want fast speed, no GUI, use this. Or, 
# You have manually open the browser. You do not want to the program to open the browser for you
# This is useful in dubugging mode, because the program always call your browser to open a new window/tab, which is annoying
#gui_path_command = *manual*

# If you are one Linux (This works in Ubuntu, other Linux unknown)
# The tail & is required to run firefox in background; otherwise, the cmd will block the main program
#gui_path_command = *firefox -new-window ./%s &*

# For Chorme: Chrome seems not support relative path, therefore, one solution is:
#gui_path_command = *"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "C:\path_to_exe_file\%s"*
# But the system() function cannot accept a string which contains 4 double-quotations (like above) (on Win10).
# Therefore, use Firefox!

# This is an np-problem. Lee algorithm guarantees the best solution for single net, but it is unknown waht is the best solution
# for multiple nets, or whether all nets can be placed.
# The program will give up after (this times net count) runs if not all nets are placed.

# If one net cannot be placed, should the program start from this net in next run?

# In some operation (e.g. back-tracing), the program tends to use the same neighbor (e.g. the left one).
# In some case, another neighbor may be a better option.
# Therefore, we shuffle the priority to allow different neighbor to be used.
